1. Although we look for our data to be normally distributed, in the real-world it is difficult to obtain a perfectly
normally distributed data. However we can still get by as long as the distribution is reasonably 'normal enough'.
With respect to CLT, over time as N increases, data may eventually converge to a more, normal distribution.
From the histogram of residuals, it looks to be close to normal but not perfect.
However, since it does appear close to normal and we could expect that as our data increases, it may become more normal,
the OLS p-value can reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing (pvalue = 2.9427105540525786e-25 < 5%).


2. With the Kalman Smoothing we result with the scores as follows:
Training score: 0.560414
Validation score: 0.488193

Even with Kalman smoothing applied, the model does not seem promising as the scores are only around 50%.
The validation score being lower than the training score indicates that our model is overfitting the data.
As the model is too specific, it has a difficult time generalizing data points on tested data and cannot effectively predict
as noise gets mixed into the specifics of the model.
