1. As our data is quite large, the plot seems to show that average max temperature can predict population density well.
It shows that daily average temperatures between 15 - 30 degrees celsius we can predict that population density may fall mostly around
500 to 3000. Populations prefer a more average temperature rather than living in extreme cold or extreme hot places.

2. Compressed files are meant to reduce overall data size, which can always be beneficial to efficiency.
Compression results in reduced data file size to store and makes it faster to transmit.
An uncompressed file is larger in size which would be slower to access.
